We parse every version of ClojureScript to build a versioned catalog for the
syntax, library, and compiler.  We also supplement this data with curated
descriptions, examples, cross-refs, and associate each ClojureScript form with
an equivalent Clojure form where appropriate.

CLJS master branch changes are represented with a pseudo-version ending in `+`.
For example, if `1.9.23` is latest published version, `1.9.23+` will represent
what is currently in master.

## Google Closure Library API?

https://google.github.io/closure-library/api/index.html

The entire Google Closure Library API is also included with ClojureScript. I
find it hard to search through, but here are the following are the main
